		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>15 minutes</p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p>
			Apps often have to save state information when leaving the foreground. In this exercise you will learn how to request enough time from the operating system to complete such an operation.

			<strong>Attention:</strong>This exercise will not work correctly on the iOS Simulators. Currently applications running on the simulators are not suspended when running in the background. You can still complete this lab on simulator but the behavior will not match a real device. For best results use a physical iOS device.
		</div>

		<h2>Required assets</h2>
		<p>
			The provided <strong>Exercise 1</strong> folder contains a subfolder named <strong>Lab.Start</strong> with a solution you should use as a starting point. There is also a <strong>Lab.Completed</strong> folder with the completed code if you want to compare your solution.
      </p>

		<h2>Exercise Overview</h2>
		<p>
			You can find a starter solution in the <strong>Lab.Start</strong> folder under <strong>Exercise 1</strong>. 
		    It overrides all lifecycle methods and logs their calls to the console and also to the app's only view so you can track to order of the individual calls.
            In the application delegate you find a method <code>SaveUserChoices()</code> that simulates saving the app's current state.&nbsp; 
	
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Call <code>SaveUserChoices()</code> when the application transitions into background state.
            </li>
			<li>To prevent termination of the app because of the long running saving process, run the method in 
                a separate <code>Task</code> and await it.
            </li>
			<li>iOS will suspend the <code>Task</code>. To avoid this, begin a Finite-Length Task and end it if the
                the saving process is finished or the available background has expired.
			</li>
			<li>Run the app and press the home button (you can simulate the home button press by using the iOS Simulator menu
                &quot;Hardware -&gt; Home&quot; or by pressing &quot;CMD+SHIFT+H&quot;) to move the app into background state.
                You should see that the output to the console continues and eventually completes.

			</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Steps -->
		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
       
		</p>


		<h2>Start a finite-length task</h2>
		<p>
			Open <code>AppDelegate.cs</code> and locate the <code>SaveUserChoices()</code> method. It simulates saving
            data by sleeping for 20 seconds. After each second it outputs something to the console. 
	   
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<code>DidEnterBackground()</code> is the method that will be called if the app moves into the background state. To execute our saving method asynchronously and to begin a Finite-Length Task, add the following code:
            <ul class="indent-none">
               <li>
                  Call <code>UIApplication.BeginBackgroundTask</code>, pass <code>null</code> for the completion callback (we'll fix this later), and store the returned identifier in the <code>taskId</code> field.
               </li>

               <li>
                  Use <code>Task.Run</code> to create a new asynchronous task and call <code>SaveUserChoices</code>.
               </li>

               <li>
                  Use the <code>async / await</code> keywords to properly wait until the task is completed (rememner this does not <em>block</em> the thread, but instead creates a continuation which executes the remainder of the code <em>after</em> the task is finished).
               </li>

               <li>
                  Call <code>UIApplication.EndBackgroundTask</code>, passing the task identifier. Wrap this call in an <code>if</code> condition that tests to make sure the <code>taskId</code> field has a valid value (!= -1) and reset it to (-1) when you have ended the iOS task.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>

<p class="indent-none">
<a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this, 'step_10'); return false;" class="uiitem">Show code</a>
<div class="indent-none" id="step_10" style="display: none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public async override void DidEnterBackground (UIApplication app)
{
  Logger.Log ("DidEnterBackground() - entered background");

  // Begin Finite-Length Task.
  this.taskId = app.BeginBackgroundTask (null);

  // Start saving the user choices.
  await Task.Run (() => this.SaveUserChoices ());

  // End Finite-Length Task, finished.
  if(this.taskId != -1)
  {
    UIApplication.SharedApplication.EndBackgroundTask (this.taskId);
    this.taskId = -1;
  }
}
</pre>
</div></p>

			<li>
            If you return to the application while the <code>SaveUserChoices()</code> method is still running you can end the Finite-Length Task. To do this, override <code>WillEnterForeground()</code> and call <code>UIApplication.EndBackgroundTask()</code>. Make sure to test the <code>taskId</code> value before calling <code>EndBackgroundTask</code>!
         </li>
               
<p class="indent-none">
<a href="#" onclick="toggleBlock(this, 'step_20', 'Show code', 'Hide'); return false;" class="uiitem">Show code</a>
<div class="indent-none" id="step_20" style="display: none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public override void WillEnterForeground (UIApplication app)
{
  Logger.Log ("WillEnterForeground() - coming from background into foreground");
  // End task, no longer needed.
  if (this.taskId >= 0)
  {
    app.EndBackgroundTask (this.taskId);
    this.taskId = -1;
  }
}
</pre>
</div>
</p>
		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>
			To prevent threads from being suspended, you must begin a Finite-Length Task. This allows you to continue an ongoing operation even if the app gets backgrounded. In this exercise, you have used the <code>BeginBackgroundTask</code> and <code>EndBackgroundTask</code> methods to enable threads to continue execution for a short period of time after your application has been backgrounded.
